# DVD_Simulation
This is a basic DVD simulation I created in pygame with python
In this project I just wanted to learn some basic skills in pygame.
I will later on use these skills to create the game snake!
I tried to make this code as clean as possible plus added some documntation on the code as I go.
I hope you will like this project and I can't wait to make many more.
If you have and suggestions to projects or for making the code neater please let me know.
Cheers,
Tomer Cahal
