# DVD_Simulation
This is a basic DVD simulation I created in pygame with python.\
In this project I just wanted to learn some basic skills in pygame.\
I will later on use these skills to create the game snake!\
I tried to make this code as clean as possible plus added some documntation on the code as I go.\
I hope you will like this project and I can't wait to make many more.\
If you have and suggestions to projects or for making the code neater please let me know.\
Cheers,\
Tomer Cahal\
